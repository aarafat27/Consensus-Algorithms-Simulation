## Consensus Algorithms

The following consensus algorithms are simulated in this project:

1. Proof of Work (PoW)
2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
4. Raft

Each algorithm has its unique way of achieving consensus in a decentralized network.

## Simulation Overview

In this project, we simulate the behavior and performance of different consensus algorithms under various conditions. Simulations help us understand how these algorithms perform in real-world scenarios.

## Languages and Libraries

The simulations are implemented using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. The following libraries are used:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Simulation Instructions

To run the simulations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/consensus-simulations.git
