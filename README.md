## Consensus Algorithms

The following consensus algorithms are simulated in this project:

1. Proof of Work (PoW)
2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
4. Raft

Each algorithm has its unique way of achieving consensus in a decentralized network.

## Simulation Overview

In this project, we simulate the behavior and performance of different consensus algorithms under various conditions. Simulations help us understand how these algorithms perform in real-world scenarios.

## Languages and Libraries

The simulations are implemented using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. The following libraries are used:

- `hashlib`: For cryptographic hashing.
- `time`: For time-related operations.
- `collections.defaultdict`: For creating a dictionary with default values.
- `random`: For generating random numbers.
- `json`: For JSON serialization and deserialization.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization using Matplotlib library.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.

## Simulation Instructions

To run the simulations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aarafat27/Consensus-Algorithms-Simulation.git
